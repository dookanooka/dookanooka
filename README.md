- 👋 Hi, I’m @dookanooka
- 👀 I've spent a couple of decades working for corporates and latterly for a university. 
I've learnt so much over that time and wanted to give back by concentrating on using my skills to help out small farmers, becoming a part time farmer myself. I'm also working on a field research application that i'll get up here soon.
I figure soil is the basis of all life on land and a solution to many of it's problems, which brings me to climate change mitigation and education, something i'm super keen to help advance with my tech skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things! It includes keeping up with React and different middlewares and databases and digging into Sveltekit, Strapi, Next.js, machine learning and AI, BLE Beacons, irrigation systems, market gardening, mesh networking, orcharding, regenerative agriculture, why my tractors broken... amongst other things!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on regenerative ag, climate change mitigation projects, horticultural and small farm projects amongst others 8o)

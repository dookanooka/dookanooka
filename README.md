- 👋 Hi, I’m @dookanooka
  
- 👀 I've spent a couple of decades working for various Coporations and latterly for the University of Tasmania. 
I've learnt so much over that time and wanted to give back by concentrating on using my skills to help out small scale and regenerative farmers. To that end, my wife and I bought 30 beautiful acres in Southern Tasmania. We've begun the journey of learning from the land by establishing a cider orchard and market garden which are about 3 years old now. From the beginning i've been concentrating on applying my technical skills to small scale farming.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things! They include keeping up with React and different middlewares and databases and digging into Sveltekit, Strapi, Sanity, machine learning and AI, BLE Beacons, irrigation systems, market gardening, orcharding, regenerative agriculture, why my tractors broken... amongst other things!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on regenerative ag, climate change mitigation projects, horticultural and small farm projects amongst others 8o)

- 📫 Reach me at ben at firetail.digital, it'd be great to hear from you
